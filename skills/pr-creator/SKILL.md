# GitHub Pull Request

## Determine Mode of Operation

Identify which mode to use based on user's request:

**Mode 1: Generate PR Content in Chat**

Use when user wants to see/copy PR content WITHOUT creating it on GitHub:

- Explicit requests: "show PR", "generate PR", "output PR", "give me PR", "PR to chat", "send to chat"
- Key indicators: Words like "show", "display", "output", "give", "send to chat" without "create"/"open"
- When unclear: If ambiguous (no existing PR, no clear "create" intent), default to this mode

**Mode 2: Create PR on GitHub**

Use when user wants to actually create PR:

- Explicit creation: "create PR", "open PR", "make PR", "submit PR"
- Clear action: User clearly wants to create/open PR on GitHub

**Default for ambiguous requests**: Use Mode 1 (generate in chat) to show user what will be created first.

## Workflow for Creating Pull Requests

Follow this workflow systematically when creating PRs:

### Step 1: Determine the Scenario

**Which scenario applies?**

- **Scenario A: Creating PR for existing branch with commits**
  - Branch exists with commits that differ from base branch
  - Need to analyze ALL commits in the branch
  - → Use git diff/log or branch comparison tools

- **Scenario B: User has uncommitted/unstaged local changes**
  - Changes not yet committed
  - User wants to commit and create PR
  - → First help commit changes, then proceed with Scenario A

**IMPORTANT**: Most PR requests are Scenario A - analyzing an existing feature branch!

### Step 2: Identify Current Branch and Base Branch

First, determine what branch you're working with:

```bash
# Get current branch name
git branch --show-current

# Identify base branch (usually main/master)
git remote show origin | grep "HEAD branch"
```

Common base branches: `master`, `main`, `develop`

### Step 3: Get Complete Branch Changes

**CRITICAL**: Analyze ALL changes in the entire branch that will be merged, not just:

- ❌ The last commit
- ❌ Previous chat context
- ❌ Individual file changes mentioned earlier

**What you need to obtain:**

- Complete diff between current branch and base branch
- List of all modified files
- All commit messages in the branch
- Full context of what changed

**How to get this information:**

**Primary approach - Git commands (universal):**

```bash
# Get full diff between branches
git diff <base-branch>...<current-branch>

# Example:
git diff main...feature-branch

# List changed files only:
git diff --name-status main...feature-branch

# See all commits in branch:
git log <base-branch>..<current-branch> --oneline
```

**Alternative - Use available tools in your environment:**

Depending on your environment, you may have access to:

- IDE diff viewers or change tracking features
- Version control UI showing branch comparisons
- File comparison tools
- Any method that shows complete changeset between branches

The key is obtaining the **complete changeset**, regardless of the method.

**For uncommitted changes:**
If changes are not yet committed, first check what's uncommitted using:

- `git status` and `git diff` (for git environments)
- Your IDE's change tracker or source control panel
- Any tool showing unstaged/uncommitted modifications

**Troubleshooting "No Changes" Issue:**

If you get empty diff or "no changes":

1. ✅ Verify you're comparing correct branches (current vs base)
2. ✅ Check if current branch IS the base branch (can't PR main to main!)
3. ✅ Ensure commits exist in branch: `git log --oneline -10`
4. ✅ Try: `git log <base-branch>..<current-branch>` to see commits
5. ❌ If truly no changes, inform user PR cannot be created without changes

### Step 4: Analyze Changes Comprehensively

1. Review **every modified file** in the branch
2. Understand the **cumulative impact** of all commits
3. Identify **affected packages/modules** (important for monorepos)
4. Note any **breaking changes** or **migration requirements**

### Step 5: Generate PR Content

Based on complete analysis, create:

- Title that reflects the **main purpose** of ALL changes
- Summary listing **all significant modifications**
- Motivation explaining **why** these changes were needed
- Related issues with proper linking

This workflow ensures PR descriptions accurately reflect the **total scope** of changes being merged.

### Step 6: Create PR or Output to Chat

**If Mode 2 (Create PR on GitHub) - Default action:**

1. Create PR using available GitHub API tools
2. After successful creation, provide user with:
   - PR URL
   - Brief confirmation message

**If Mode 1 (Generate in Chat) - Fallback:**

Output the PR content in chat using the format described in "Fallback: Output Format for Chat" section.

**Skip GitHub creation if:**

- User explicitly requested text output only (Mode 1)
- Authentication/API errors occur (then fallback to Mode 1)
- Request is ambiguous (then fallback to Mode 1 to show user what will be created)

## Language Requirement

**CRITICAL**: Always write all PR content (title, description, comments) in English only, regardless of the chat language or user's preferred language. This is a strict requirement for all generated PR content.

## Fallback: Output Format for Chat

**Use this format when in Mode 1 (Generate PR Content in Chat):**

- User explicitly requests viewing/copying PR content (see "Determine Mode of Operation" section above)
- Cannot create PR due to API/authentication issues
- Request is ambiguous (no clear "create" intent)
- User specifically asks not to create the PR yet

When outputting PR content to chat instead of creating it on GitHub:

**ALWAYS wrap the complete PR content in a markdown code block:**

````markdown
[PR Title Here]

[Full PR Description Here]
````

This allows user to easily copy the entire PR content with proper formatting preserved.

**DO NOT** output PR content as rendered markdown in chat - it must be in a copyable code block.

## PR Title

- ≤50 characters, imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added" or "Adds")
- Accurately reflect main purpose of changes
- No issue numbers in title (use description)
- For monorepos, consider a scoped title (e.g., `feat(scope): description`)

**Examples:**

- Add dark mode support to theme package
- Fix input validation in text field component
- Refactor build configuration for better performance

## PR Description

**Required sections:**

1. **Summary** - What changed (bullet points, mention affected packages/modules)
2. **Motivation** - Why these changes were necessary, impact on project
3. **Related Issues** - `Fixes #123`, `Closes #456`, `Related to #789`

**Optional sections:**

- Testing Notes
- Breaking Changes (with migration guide)
- Performance Impact

**Example:**

```markdown
## Summary

Adds dark mode support to the theme package:

- Added dark color palette with semantic tokens
- Updated CSS variables for theme switching
- Added theme toggle component

## Motivation

Users requested dark mode to reduce eye strain and improve accessibility.

## Related Issues

Fixes #42
```

## Writing Style

**Style Reference:**

- Always write using a similar style as this example: "This is a community for chill dudes😎👍 who love to puff on a hookah🌬 with double apple🍎🍏, know their way around bowl packs💨, aren’t fans of vapers🤣, and respect their ladies👩‍🦳🙏."
- Use emojis as frequently as shown in the example
- Do not include the example message itself in PR descriptions, just use it as a style reference

See [references/pr-examples.md](references/pr-examples.md) for more examples.

## Edge Cases

- **Large changesets**: Group changes by component in summary
- **Updating existing PR**: Preserve metadata, add update comment
- **Breaking changes**: Mark clearly, provide migration guide
- **Monorepo**: Clearly indicate affected packages
